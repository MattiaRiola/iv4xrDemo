# iv4xr Demo

This is a demo for the [iv4xr Agent-based Testing Framework](https://github.com/iv4xr-project/aplib). This repository contains
a configurable game called _Lab Recruits_ that is used to demonstrate how iv4xr agents
can be used to test it. The game is included as binary; else you can build it yourself
from its [repository](https://github.com/iv4xr-project/labrecruits).

More complete documentation: work in progress.
